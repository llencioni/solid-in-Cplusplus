# S.O.L.I.D. design principles in C++ 

S.O.L.I.D is a acronym for a set of principles in Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

It stands for:

**S** --> **Single responsability principle** (a class should have only one reason to change, or a class should have just one responsability)

**O** --> **Open-close principle** (SW Components,such as classes, modules, function, etc, should be open for extension but close for modifications)

**L** --> **Liskov principle** (objects of a superclass can be should be replaceable with objects of subclass without altering the correctness of program)

**I** --> **Interface segregation** (clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they donâ€™t need)

**D** --> **Dependency inversion**

This repository contains practical examples (collect over the internet) implementing SOLID principles in C++.
